## Product Vision

We are building an application for teachers to replace their google excel sheet when marking their students attendance.

## Problem Statement

Teachers are marking their students attendance using excel sheets and by calling their names one by one, which could be time consuming and the teacher might forget to do it sometimes. We are aiming to fix this by making attendance marking one of the students responsibility by creating an application for the students to mark their attendance at each class, reducing time taken for shouting names one by one as well as marking the students who arrive after the names shouting process.

## Target Audience

Our product is designed to help teachers save time marking their students' attendance by shifting the responsibility from the teacher to the student. It's designed for the teachers as well as the students.

## Value Proposition

Our product provides a new technique to mark students attendance by letting the students scan a QR code or enter a numeric code that is generated at every lecture to mark their attendance. All the teacher has to do is generate that code and let the students mark their attendance whenever they arrive at the class. This will eliminate time taken to shout each name as well as having to mark every one who arrives after the name shouting. In addition, statistics will be shown for the teacher about how many students attended, what are the times students mostly show up and more.

## Key Features and Functionality

- Teachers can create a lecture with QR or numeric code.
- Students can scan or write the code to mark their attendance.
- Student and teacher accounts must be created and verified.
- Teachers can view statistics of the lecture such as students attended, time interval, and more.
- To make sure the student don't scan the code from their homes, we will use GPS current location to verify that the student is at the campus when they mark their attendance.

## Goals and Objectives

We aim to make a responsive application that is production ready to be used by modern universities and that could be integrated into the current systems of Metropolia and other universities. Our goal is to make a web platform that could be accessed easily by students and teachers.

## Vision Statement

Our vision is to let the teacher focus more on the lectures and less on marking attendance whenever a new student arrives. Also, we want to distribute responsibilities in the class between students and teachers. This will save time and effort for both sides.
